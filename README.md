# Preparing for the New Economy

## Overview and Origin
![Qolo Logo](images/Qolo_logo.jpg)
* Founded in 2018
* Founders: Patricia Montesi, Darren Beyer, Steven Bishop, and Robert Pincus
* The birth of the Qolo platform stemmed from the company's mission to make complex payment transactions simple for business-to-business transactions. The payments solution was officially launched in June 2020.
* This company is privately funded and Dun & Bradstreet reports that their annual revenue for 2020 is $174,088 USD.

## Business Activities

### Challenges of Cross-Border Payments

The B2B payments market within the payments industry is largely untapped by digital technology. The cross-border payment arena has not advanced in innovation as quickly as the overall payments industry due to its complexity. These transactions involve multiple parties, foreign fees, security risks, legal and regulatory framework varying by country, and many other challenges. Qolo aims to create a streamlined, integrated platform for every B2B payment - domestic to the United States and globally. Qolo emphasizes the importance of an all-encompassing payments hub that is fast, easy-to-implement, and secure.

### Target Market 

The company's intended customers are businesses involved in cross-border B2B payments.
The total value of the target customers is estimated to be more than $27 trillion and is expected to reach $35 trillion in 2022. These values vary among several market research resources by about $4-$5 trillion.
    
### Competitive Advantage

**Interact** - Qolo's Embedded Processing capability, allows clients to be actively involved in each transaction. Qolo implements their processing functionality by directly integrating it into the clients' platform. Clients aren't required to develop and build their own platform to accomodate their needs. This allows clients to maximize their capabailities with an easy-to-use, integrated platform.

**Technologies** - Qolo's comprehensive platform is flexible and does not require clients to go with a one-size-fits-all approach. Qolo does not disclose their proprietary technology, but the following is a high-level overview extracted from the Qolo website.

* Payments Hub - an omnichannel payment hub
* Accounts - proprietary rules engine
* Security - QoloCrypt, patent-pending qoloCrypto technology

## Landscape:

* Qolo is in the Payments/Billing domain and sees a future in the cross-border B2B payments arena.

* This domain has been slowly moving toward cashless payments within the last 5-10 years and now has come to an accelerated pace with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Artificial intelligence, blockchain, and machine learning as well as the innovation of real-time payments are disrupting cross-border B2B payments. Checks and bank transfers still take up the largest payment volume in B2B payments, but now B2B companies are diversifying payment methods. The decline of paper payment methods is at a much slower rate than the decline of those methods within the P2P payments arena.

* Major Players: PayPal, TransferWise, moneycorp, Visa B2B Connect, Remitly, Stripe, Tipalti, and Flywire
  
## Results

* **Qolo's Impact** - Qolo has recently partnered with moneycorp to research alternative innovative solutions to improve efficiency around digital payments, especially in foreign exchange markets.

* **Core Metrics**
    1. Speed - most important for AP professionals' suppliers
    2. Security - needs tremendous improvement in reliability and security
    3. Costs - reduce fees with foreign currency transactions

* **Qolo's Performance** - Qolo is focusing on embedded processing, payments solutions, and cross-currency payments. With Qolo being a relatively new player in this domain, there is not much available information to gauge how well Qolo is doing compared to the core metrics and its competitors. However, Qolo has been able to identify the key areas to focus on for the future of this domain in order to tap into the underserved cross-border payments arena.

    > "In terms of 5-10 years out, we feel international B2B payments is the biggest and most underserved area. Nearly $25 trillion a year of international trade and services business is conducted through banks. Companies are paying 3% in fees – they are overpaying, it isn’t automated, it is horribly inefficient and is ripe for disruption. When you combine this with an advanced AR/AP capability (something we have filed patents on), the opportunity is there to dramatically streamline and lower costs of business payments." - *Patricia Montesi, CEO of Qolo*
