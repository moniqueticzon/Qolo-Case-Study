### What is the problem? insert image, maybe?

    The B2B payments market within the payments industry is largely untapped by digital technology. 
    Cross-border payment has not advanced in innovation as quickly as the overall payments industry due to its complexity. These transactions involve multiple parties, foreign fees, security risks, legal and regulatory framework varying by country, and many other challenges. Qolo aims to create a streamlined, integrated platform for every B2B payment - domestic to the United States and globally. Qolo emphasizes the importance of an all-encompassing payments hub that is fast, easy-to-implement, and secure.

### Target Market 

    The company's intended customers are businesses involved in cross-border B2B payments.
    The total value of the target customers is estimated to be more than $27 trillion and is expected to reach $35 trillion in 2022. These values vary among several market research resources by about $4-$5 trillion.
